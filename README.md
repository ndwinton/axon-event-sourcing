## Event sourcing with Axon and Spring Boot

This is inspired by the code at
https://github.com/dashsaurabh/event-sourcing-cqrs-axon-spring-boot
as described in [this blog post](http://progressivecoder.com/implementing-event-sourcing-using-axon-and-spring-boot-part-1/)
but using Kotlin for the implementation and Spock for testing.
